Last time I asked if there were any fans of Rick and Morty out there. It turns out there are! Rick got a lot of love, so let's give him some company. He redeemed his voucher for a replacement Morty.

I created this model in ZBrush. I used ZSpheres to get the main body shape there. I modeled him in an A pose, then I moved his arms to get them in the right position. Then I just went through, extracted the areas where his clothes are, then I shaped and added details to the face.

After modeling I ran it through Meshmixer to plane cut the feet so he'll stand normally. Then I also exported it in STL format from there. I printed it on my Wanhao D7 with FunToDo Snow White Resin.

Then my wife sanded and primed it. She used her airbrush to paint the skin colors on, then used paintbrushes and acrylic paints to paint everything else. Then we just super glued it to the base.
