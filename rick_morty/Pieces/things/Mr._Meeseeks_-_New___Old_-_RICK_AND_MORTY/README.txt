# Summary

First off, I did not make these models.  They were made by 3dprintguy (http://www.3dprintguy.co/).  I was looking for a better Rick model and found his website by accident.  His models appear to have been designed for resin printing.  They were hollow and had a large opening on their bottoms.

I added a base and closed the gap on the backside.  My printer does not handle models like these well, so I made the support version for keeping everything in place.

I tried printing these originally at about 80mm tall, but the legs were so thin they snapped during printing.  The above models are 125mm tall, plus the base.

I don't have any rights to these models or anything Rick and Morty related.  I'm just a fan and wanted to post these for those who wouldn't find 3dprintguy's models on their own.
